Named after the iconic AI character in the Portal video games, the glados package can be used for scientific computing in a variety of domains. Let's take a look at some of the applications in the current version of glados.

`euclidean`

The Euclidean distance measures the shortest possible distance between two points on a plane. Mathematically, it is defined as $d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(q_{i} - p_{i})^{2}}$, where $p$ and $q$ represent two $n$-dimensional vectors (data points), and $p_{i}, q_{i}$ represent the $i$-th element of the respective vector.
